## Project Overview

The elusive colony of Roanoke has fascinated scholars, historians, and locals for centuries. While theories of Roanoke's demise are abundant, they are nothing but conspiracy. Through the lens of historical research, this project aims to analyze the timeline and physical evidence of the missing colony and create a compelling conclusion to the centuries' long mystery. Furthermore, the project aims to evaluate the cultural relevance of the lost colony, and reveal the truth behind our society's view on race, land, and values.

## Project Review

The students at Butler University present information about the Roanoke colony in an easy-to-read layout. Just by looking at the homepage, readers will be able to immediately pick out the important sections of the project, which are:
* timelines
* evidence
* theories
* media

What makes this project interesting, at first glance, is that it does not solely focus on the historical mystery of the colony, but rather it also incorporates the cultural phenomena of the missing Roanoke. This cultural fascination with Roanoke is equally as mysterious, as the colony was not considered missing until the 19th century, over two centuries after its disappearance. 

### Timeline

When looking at the timeline section, it is clear to the reader that the project is well-researched. Rather than presenting the timeline of events in a simple line, the project authors created an interactive map, which includes several pinpoints to explore.

While the map is a good visual aid, there are some problems with it. 

For a viewer of the project, there is not much clarity with how to use the map. It appears to be a click-and-drag map, but the project authors also included arrows on either side. While the arrows may seem intuitive, clicking on them makes the timeline jump out of it's chronological order. A suggestion for the project authors would be to make a legend for the readers on how to use the map properly. 

Also, the timeline ends abruptly with the landing of the pilgrims in New England in 1620. I understand that this piece of information is valuable for context, but I would have liked to have seen the timeline end with something related to the Roanoke colony. It would have been fascinating to watch the timeline follow the "discoveries" of evidence related to the lost colony, such as the Dare stones. 

### Evidence

At the opening page for the evidence tab, the website presents three distinct sections:
* Dare Stones
* Croatoan
* Site X

While there is not a lot of evidence listed in this section, it is understandable as the colony left behind practically no trace of its existence.

When looking at the Dare Stones sub-section, there seems to be a lot of research. However, I do feel that the Dare Stones could be presented in a stronger layout. Rather than writing the words of the stone onto the page, I believe that there should be stronger distinction between the stone's carvings and the rest of the page's information. A simple change, such as a different colored background, would suffice. 

I also believe that there should be a translation for the stones. While ELizabethan English is not too different from modern English, there were still a couple of words that I could not make out. While the summary of the stones are informative, I believe it is more fascinating to read from the primary source. I would suggest having a mirrored version of the stones below in plain English. 

The information presented in the Dare Stones section, overall, is very fascinating. I did not realize that 48 counterfeit stones were submitted to archaeologists. The historical context of the Great Depression and the reward money for the stones also adds to the long-standing lore of the colony.
