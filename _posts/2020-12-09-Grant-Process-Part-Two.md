## Continuation of Grant Proposal Process

### As the semester moves to a close, I have been successful in completing the documentation needed to submit a grant proposal. As a review, I have completed each of the following:

**Grant Narrative**
* Summarizes the goals and objectives of the proposed grant
* Explains how proposed grant is tied into current events
* Generates interest in project for grant reviewers

**Environmental Scan**
* Demonstrates areas of research that are necessary for the grant
* Explores DH projects that are similar and dissimilar to the grant
* Explains the scholarly apparatus that is being built or created 

**Bibliography**
* Provides a list of ten sources used in the creation of the grant proposal

**Budget**
* Illustrates the financial needs of the proposed grant
* Offers concrete objectives for how to complete the grant

**Resume**
* Generates ethos for the grant presenter (That's me!)
