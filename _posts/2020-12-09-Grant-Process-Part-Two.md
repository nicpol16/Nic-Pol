## Continuation of the Grant Proposal Process

### As the semester moves to a close, I have been successful in completing the documentation needed to submit a grant proposal. As a review, I have completed each of the following:

**Grant Narrative**
* Summarizes the goals and objectives of the proposed grant
* Explains how proposed grant is tied into current events
* Generates interest in project for grant reviewers

**Environmental Scan**
* Demonstrates areas of research that are necessary for the grant
* Explores DH projects that are similar and dissimilar to the grant
* Explains the scholarly apparatus that is being built or created 

**Bibliography**
* Provides a list of ten sources used in the creation of the grant proposal

**Budget**
* Illustrates the financial needs of the proposed grant
* Offers concrete objectives for how to complete the grant

**Resume**
* Generates ethos for the grant presenter (That's me!)
* Provides the grant reviewers a background on the presenter

## Setbacks and Triumphs
Writing the documents for this grant proposal has *had* its ups and downs. I have found that when writing for these documents, I tend to write a lot about the research involved. For example, my environmental scan is almost only about research. There is only a tiny sentence at the end that tells the reader that my grant project is important. 

I think that the reason for why I undermine my project's importance in these documents is because of the fact that I am not used to "hyping" up myself or my work. Of course, I am very passionate about my project. Yet, writing about how amazing my project is or how innovative the project will be for the Digital Humanities world is uncomfortable for me to write. 

This feeling of uncomfort has hurt the quality of my writing. Specifically, I have weaker concluding paragraphs for my Environmental Scan and Grant Narrative. Both of those documents need concluding paragraphs that are supposed to generate interest in the project. However, my concluding paragraphs in the first drafts are continuations of my research on the project topic. 

The only way that I was able to get out of this self-inflicted trap was through the mechanics of peer reviews. This brings me to my next section...

## Peer Review!
The remainder of the semester has been spent doing peer reviews with classmates. These peer reviews are always helpful, as they allow for a fresh pair of eyes to catch for thematic and grammatical errors. 

For every document that I have made, I have recieved a peer review. Depending on the peer, suggestions and critiques can be extremely helpful. My favorite peer reviews are when I recieve comments on how to improve my syntax. 

These reviews happen on google docs, which I prefer because it allows the reviewer to mark up my document. 

The image below depicts a helpful peer review for my Grant Narrative.

Even more helpful are peer reviews in which the reviewer/peer points out places in the document where I should re-focus on the importance of my project. An example of this type of peer review on my Environmental Scan is attached below:

## Future Plans of the Grant Process
The only step left for this project is just to revise my documents. This has been such an enjoyable experience, as I have been able to write about my favorite era in history. Not only did I get to explore the world of Thera further, but I also had the ability to tie the historical event to my academic interests. 

It saddens me that all of this effort will not matriculate into a finalized project. The purpose of this grant proposal was to learn how to structure and format documents in the Digital Humanities industry. It was never an actual goal, for myself or for the class, to submit this grant for review. 

That said, if I were not a senior I would have seriously considered looking into the grant submission process for CNU. I do believe that the project that I have created is something unique, as well as something that has not yet been done in academia before.
