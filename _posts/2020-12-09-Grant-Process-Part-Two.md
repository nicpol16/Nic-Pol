## Continuation of Grant Proposal Process

### As the semester moves to a close, I have been successful in completing the documentation needed to submit a grant proposal. As a review, I have completed each of the following:

**Grant Narrative**
* Summarizes the goals and objectives of the proposed grant
* Explains how proposed grant is tied into current events
* Generates interest in project for grant reviewers

**Environmental Scan**
* Demonstrates areas of research that are necessary for the grant
* Explores DH projects that are similar and dissimilar to the grant
* Explains the scholarly apparatus that is being built or created 

**Bibliography**
* Provides a list of ten sources used in the creation of the grant proposal

**Budget**
* Illustrates the financial needs of the proposed grant
* Offers concrete objectives for how to complete the grant

**Resume**
* Generates ethos for the grant presenter (That's me!)
* Provides the grant reviewers a background on the presenter

## Peer Review
Most of the remainder of the semester has been spent doing peer reviews with classmates. These peer reviews are always helpful, as they allow for a fresh pair of eyes to catch for thematic and grammatical errors. 

For every document that I have made, I have recieved a peer review. Depending on the peer, suggestions and critiques can be extremely helpful. My favorite peer reviews are when I recieve comments on how to improve my syntax. The image below depicts a helpful peer review.
