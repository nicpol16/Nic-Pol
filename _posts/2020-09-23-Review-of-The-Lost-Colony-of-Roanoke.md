## Project Overview

The elusive colony of Roanoke has fascinated scholars, historians, and American culture for centuries. While theories of Roanoke's demise are abundant, most are nothing but conspiracy. Through the lens of historical research, this project aims to analyze the timeline and physical evidence of the missing colony to create a compelling conclusion to the centuries' long mystery. Furthermore, the project also interprets the history of America's obsession with the lost colony.

## Project Review

The students at Butler University present information about the Roanoke colony in an easy-to-read layout. Just by looking at the homepage, readers will be able to immediately pick out the important sections of the project, which are:
* timelines
* evidence
* theories
* media

What makes this project interesting, at first glance, is that it does not only focus on the historical mystery of the colony, but rather it also incorporates the cultural phenomena of the missing Roanoke. This cultural fascination with Roanoke is equally as mysterious, as the colony was not considered missing until the 19th century, over two centuries after its disappearance. 

### Timeline

When looking at the timeline section, it is clear to the reader that the project is well-researched. Rather than presenting the timeline of events in a simple line, the project authors created an interactive map, which includes several pinpoints to explore. The map is generated through StoryMapJS, a mapping software.

While the map is a good visual aid, there are some problems with it. 

There is not much clarity with how to use the map. It appears to be a click-and-drag map, but the project authors also include arrows on either side. While the arrows may seem intuitive, clicking on them makes the timeline jump out of it's chronological order. A suggestion for the project authors would be to make a legend for the readers on how to use the map properly. 

Also, the timeline ends abruptly with the landing of the pilgrims in New England in 1620. I understand that this piece of information is valuable for context, but I would have liked to have seen the timeline end with something related to the Roanoke colony. It would have been fascinating to watch the timeline follow the "discoveries" of evidence related to the lost colony, such as the Dare stones. 

### Evidence

At the opening page for the evidence tab, the website presents three distinct sections:
* Dare Stones
* Croatoan
* Site X

While there is not a lot of evidence listed in this section, it is understandable as the colony left behind practically no trace of its existence.

For the few pieces of the evidence that does exist, however, they are displayed in a clear format. The evidence section also includes interesting anecdotes. For example, when the Dare Stones were found, only one of them was actually considered authentic. However, the stone was found during the Great Depression, and archaeologists were sending out reward money to locals of Cape Hatteras to find more stones related to Roanoke. As a result, 48 additional stones were brought in, with all of them being counterfeit. 

### Theories

The theories section is split into two main sections:
* Colonists joined the Native Americans
* Colonists were attacked by Native Americans

What makes this section fascinating is that there is a stark contrast between the two theories. Essentially, the theory that the colonists assimilated with the Natives is supported by contemporaries of that era, including John White, who was the governor of Roanoke in the 1587 expedition. The project also included this powerful quote from Governor White:

"But although it much grieved me to see such spoyle of my goods, yet on the other side I greatly joyed that I had safely found a certaine token of their safe being at Croatoan which is the place where Manteo was borne and the Savages of the land of our friends," - White

The other theory developed in 1837, during the height of racial divides in American History. During the Jacksonian era, American culture was focused on preserving its English heritage as a way to rationalize slavery. During this time, the concept of cultural assimilation would have seemed immoral. Furthermore, the 1830's saw the rise in racism against Native Americans in the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the subsequent Trail of Tears in 1831. The project does a good job capitalizing on this emotion of grief and regret, as well as embarrassment of our country's past. 

### Media

This section follows the media that has been produced based on the Roanoke Colony. 

I would admit that this was the weak point of the project. While this section includes some popular TV shows, like American Horror Story, I do not believe that contemporary television is a good example of all of the literature, poetry, films, and dramas produced since the 16th century. If the project were to revise this section, I would have liked to have seen popular novels from the Jacksonian era, and maybe even news announcements from the 16th and 17th century related to Roanoke and colonialism. 

### Conclusion

I do believe that this project was informative, as there was a lot of historical research used. The technology used could be improved upon, such as the interactive map in the timeline section. But the layout was intuitive and easy to use. The sections were easy to access and I was able to move around the website with ease. The project will also change the reader's perspective of the colony. The main takeaway is that the colony was never lost, but that the racist culture of the 19th century has made America, in a way, lost from its own history.
