### Grant Proposal Process

Living in the midst of a pandemic, most of us have felt the economic, emotional, and societal breakdown of the past year. Truly, it is a moment in time that will be remembered for decades to come. The death toll in the United States, which surpassed 200,000 in September, is a startling figure to look at. 

But as tragic as the COVID-19 pandemic has been, there is a much deadlier entity lurking among us. Climate Change.

According to Bill Gates, [by 2060, climate change could be just as deadly as COVID-19, and by 2100 it could be five times as deadly.](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Climate-and-COVID-19).
