Living in the midst of a pandemic, most of us have felt the economic, emotional, and societal breakdown of the past year. Truly, it is a moment in time that will be remembered for decades to come. The death toll in the United States, which surpassed 200,000 in September of 2020, is a horrifying statistic. 

But as tragic as the COVID-19 pandemic has been, there is a much deadlier entity lurking among us. *Climate change.*

According to Bill Gates, [by 2060, climate change could be just as deadly as COVID-19, and by 2100 it could be five times as deadly.](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Climate-and-COVID-19)

While many of us are aware that climate change exists, most of society is not aware of how deadly the environmental impacts will get. Severe droughts, acidified water, and mass-extinction events are projected to take place [only fifty years from now.](https://www.globalcitizen.org/de/content/half-earths-species-extinct-2050/) 

While our future seems scary, humanity has gone through similar disasters, albiet these events were not man-made. That said, humanity has survived apocalyptic conditions before. The way that humanity adapted to these climactic changes can teach us on how our future society will adapt to a changing world. 

### Choosing A Topic

The most important part of grant-writing is centering a project around a topic that you feel passionate about. In our Digital Humanities class, Dr. Stover presented a list of types of grants that the National Endowement for the Humanities. This list guided me on what I should choose. 

I wanted to go for a historical-based topic, and specifically I wanted to focus on tragic parts of history that could tie into climate change. 
I decided to write a grant proposal on the eruption of Thera, a volcano that erupted in the 16th century B.C.E.

For the uninitiated,
