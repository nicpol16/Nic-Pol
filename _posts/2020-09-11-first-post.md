# An Introduction 
## Hello, My name is Nicolas Pol...
![Profile Pic](https://nicpol16.github.io/Nic-Pol/images/profile.jpg)
...And I am currently a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu). While I am sad to be graduating within the coming months, I can confidently say that I am proud of what I have done with my academic career. 

From the start of college, I knew that I wanted to get involved with environmental policy. What excites me about that industry is that the environmental world is so **new**. Think of environmental policy as the wild west of the modern age, but instead of coyboys and banditos, we have lobbyists and auditors. 

While at CNU, I have been working as the co-president of [Roots & Shoots](https://cnu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/rootsandshoots), an environmental organization based on volunteerism and stewardship. Roots & Shoots has exponentially enriched my life, as I have been able to work with local government, local businesses, and school districts.

A couple of Roots & Shoots projects includes:
* Building a [Bee-Byway](http://www.beebyway.com) for the Hampton Roads Peninsula
* Cleaning Newport News trails, such as the [Noland Trail](https://www.marinersmuseum.org/park-and-trail/)
* Building a [Riparian Buffer](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/smallfarms/what-riparian-buffer) for Causey's Mill Park 
* Host professional panels with Newport News officials, Christopher Newport University faculty, and environmental experts

Also, Roots & Shoots has something to offer for every major. For me, personally, I am a Political Science major, but I still have found ways to connect the organization to my major's academic interests. For anyone else interested in Roots & Shoots, you can always e-mail at rootsandshoots@cnu.edu

Other than Roots & Shoots, I have been involved in the following organizations:
* Asian Student Union (I am a quarter Chinese, and when I was a child I could speak some Cantonese!)
* Tennis Club 
* Food Fighters - A wonderful organization that donates CNU's food to the Peninsula Food Bank in Hampton, VA
* The Student Sustainability Commission - A branch of Student Assembly that focuses on sustainability efforts
* CNU's Doctors without Borders - Focuses on providing aid to local refugees in the Hampton Roads region of VA

In my personal life, I am a very devoted older brother.
