# An Introduction 
## Hello, My name is Nicolas Pol...
![Profile Pic](https://nicpol16.github.io/Nic-Pol/images/profile.jpg)
...And I am currently a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu). While I am sad to be graduating within the coming months, I can confidently say that I am proud of what I have done with my academic career. 

From the start of college, I knew that I wanted to get involved with environmental policy. What excites me about that industry is that the environmental world is so **new**. Think of environmental policy as the wild west of the modern age, but instead of coyboys and banditos, we have lobbyists and auditors.
