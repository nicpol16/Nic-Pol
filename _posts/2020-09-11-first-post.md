# An Introduction 
## Hello, My name is Nic...
![Profile Pic](https://nicpol16.github.io/Nic-Pol/images/profile.jpg)
...And I am currently a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu). While I am sad to be graduating within the coming months, I can confidently say that I am proud of what I have done with my academic career. 

From the start of college, I knew that I wanted to get involved with environmental policy. What excites me about that industry is that the environmental world is so **new**. Think of environmental policy as the wild west of the modern age, but instead of cowboys and banditos, we have lobbyists and auditors. 

While at CNU, I have been working as the co-president of [Roots & Shoots](https://cnu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/rootsandshoots), an environmental organization based on volunteerism and stewardship. Roots & Shoots has exponentially enriched my life, as I have been able to work with local government, local businesses, and school districts.

### A couple of Roots & Shoots projects includes:
* Building a [Bee-Byway](http://www.beebyway.com) for the Hampton Roads Peninsula
* Cleaning Newport News trails, such as the [Noland Trail](https://www.marinersmuseum.org/park-and-trail/)
* Building a [Riparian Buffer](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/smallfarms/what-riparian-buffer) for Causey's Mill Park 
* Host professional panels with Newport News officials, Christopher Newport University faculty, and environmental experts

Also, Roots & Shoots has something to offer for every major. For me, personally, I am a Political Science major, but I still have found ways to connect the organization to my major's academic interests. For anyone else interested in Roots & Shoots, you can always e-mail at rootsandshoots@cnu.edu

Other than Roots & Shoots, I have been involved in the following organizations:
* Asian Student Union (I am a quarter Chinese, and when I was a child I could speak some Cantonese!)
* Tennis Club 
* Food Fighters - A wonderful organization that donates CNU's food to the Peninsula Food Bank in Hampton, VA
* The Student Sustainability Commission - A branch of Student Assembly that focuses on sustainability efforts
* CNU's Doctors without Borders - Focuses on providing aid to local refugees in the Hampton Roads region of VA

### In my personal life, I am a devoted older brother to my four younger siblings.

My sister sitting next to me in the photograph, Grace, also has high-functioning Autism. Watching Grace grow up has been a very bittersweet experience for me. While I am happy to see her develop her own unique personality, I have often been saddened by the stigma that still surrounds Autism. 

My sister does not move through life like most children do, and because of that her classmates have often classified her as "strange" or "weird." When I am home, I spend most of my freetime volunteering at her school to help her feel comfortable in her school's environment as well as to help her communicate with her classmates during lunch and recess.
